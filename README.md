## Features

- Set a countdown timer as far as December 31, 2100
- Add a background music in your countdown via Youtube and Spotify
- Set a background for your countdown (.mp4 and .gif)
- See the timer on the tab when it is not active
- Set the font style via Google Fonts
- Light and Dark modes
- Set the color of the timer or have it adjust to whatever is in the background

Of all the countdown sites I've ventured, I haven't encountered one where it doesn't overwhelm the user with inputs, have music and non-static background. I want to create an event countdown timer that user can immediately tell where to set their countdown, set a background music they wish and background that symbolizes the upcoming event.

My background music and background are resource efficient and will not slow your computer down.
